# TCT_TGS
A pipeline for identifying transposable element (TE) chimeric transcripts (TCTs) in tumor cells using long-read RNA-seq. It includes read alignment, transcript assembly and annotation, reference transcriptome generation, expression quantification, and open-reading frame prediction, enabling insights into potential oncogenic mechanisms.
